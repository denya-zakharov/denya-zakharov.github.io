      <p>2024/ World of Tanks Homepage Redesign </p>

      <div class="project-images" id="project-images">
        <p>The WoT Homepage Redesign was a major project I undertook as a part of the Web Stream in World of Tanks. My role in the project focused on UX/UI design for the homepage, including all widgets and select areas of the Admin Panel that required UX improvements. I was responsible for ensuring a seamless and transparent experience across the entire page, consistency, and compatability with the existing WoT portal infrastructure. Apart from me, the workgroup consisted of a System Designer, Producer, PM, Frontend/Backend devs, and QA. Each member played a crucial role in shaping and implementing the changes within the MVP scope.</p>
        <p>The homepage serves as a primary source of news for a significant portion of users and plays a crucial role in communication with them. On a good day, the number of daily visitors reaches XXXX users.</p>

          <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1059127522?h=38ee921c81&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&amp;autoplay=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="newbie-demo" loading="lazy"></iframe>
        </div>

        <p>The main goal was to increase the reach and retention of the audience of the official portal by enhancing the usefulness and convenience of the portal for users. The change of the visual and functional appearance to increase engagement with current in-game events and systems included:</p>
        <ul class="project-list">
          <li class="project-list-item">Active audience - Increase of engagement into current in-game events and news.</li>
          <li class="project-list-item">NewMAU (Monthly Active Users) - Maintain conversions at the current level or improve them</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For both user groups, it was critical to minimize any loss in visits and premium shop banner clicks.</p>

        </div>
        <script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

        
        <p>WoT portal had a system that distinguished between users in categories based on a cookie and additional rules. This system enabled some level of customization in content delivery. This system was reworked to simplify user segmentation and better allign it with product requirements reducing the number of groups to just two: new players and returning players.</p>

        <p>As a result, each group now sees a slightly different version of the page. New players are presented with an onboarding promo block that encourages them to register and download the game, while returning players see the latest major news update.</p>

        <p>World of Tanks has a long-standing history, with many elements being reworked, updated, and then revised again over time. As a result, finding up-to-date guidelines and standards became nearly impossible. This presented the perfect opportunity to introduce a structured set of guidelines and commit to maintaining them. To ensure consistency, the following standards were established: typography rules, iconography, colors, spacings, content area width, and responsive breakpoints. As a result, design and development now have a clear set of elements and rules to follow in every future reworks, ensuring consistency and coherence across all updates.</p>
        <img class="project-image" src="https://ucarecdn.com/73ac0e20-1a94-4097-9361-e431a8a449ab/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/" alt="figma variables illustration" loading="lazy"/>
        
        <p>After several brainstorming sessions and a few months in the concept stage, gathering approvals and feedback, we established a clear list of changes to be covered within the MVP scope. These changes included:</p>

        <ul class="project-list">
          <li class="project-list-item">Menu Update – Fixing mobile behavior and adding support for a new content area on desktop. A category rework was also planned but didn’t make it into the MVP.</li>
          <li class="project-list-item">New Players / Returning Players Section (Promo Block) – A cookie-based section designed to tailor content for different user groups.</li>
          <li class="project-list-item">News Section Rework – Expanding the number of news items, implementing clear prioritization, and accommodating different scenarios based on the number of key news items.</li>
          <li class="project-list-item">Monetization Section Update – Creating a dedicated way to promote in-game items for special promotions. Previously, these promotions were presented as news items, but after the redesign, they became direct links to the Premium Store. Additionally, an entry point to the Premium and Merch Store was planned but was instead moved to a dedicated category on the page. Later tests showed no significant CTR difference.</li>
          <li class="project-list-item">Event Calendar – Introducing a structured way to display in-game activities on a timeline.</li>
          <li class="project-list-item">Customization Presets for Special Events – Enabling thematic design updates for events like New Year and Anniversary celebrations.</li>
          <li class="project-list-item">Footer and Language Selector Update</li>
        </ul>
        <img class="project-image" src="https://ucarecdn.com/e95e51c7-22a0-4fa0-9bda-928c44b5c135/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/" alt="01" loading="lazy"/>

        <p>The most significant menu rework was on mobile. Previously, there were two large buttons: the left one opened the category menu for portal navigation, while the right one attempted to open a shared menu across all WOT products (Common Menu). The new design moves the main navigation to the left for easier access, while the Common Menu is now always visible at the top. Additionally, a "Create Account" CTA was added.</p>

        <p>One remaining issue is that categories like "Game" and "Guides" have their own pages. The original plan was to restructure the menu fully, but due to time constraints and legacy issues, this wasn't possible. As a temporary solution, tapping the category name now opens the page and anywhere else opens a dropdown, previously the only way to open the dropdown was to tap the icon on the right. A proper fix is planned for MVP+</p>

        </div>
        <script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></div>


        <p>Latest News is the main section featuring all the latest and greatest peaces of news. Updates, collaborations. A card layout was chosen as it is both flexible and familiar.</p>

        <img class="project-image" src="https://ucarecdn.com/89909d9d-ca71-40be-8e05-7cb0ef7fb112/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/" alt="05" loading="lazy"/>

        <p>It was crucial to design a consistent card component that accommodates all potential use cases. Currently, it supports two: News and Special Items, with more to come. The card includes tags, dates, buttons, an image, text, two alignment options: horizontal and vertical and three states: default, hover and visited. All cards use the same image size and safe content area, streamlining asset preparation and saving significant time.</p>

        <img class="project-image" src="https://ucarecdn.com/6a282fc4-0516-4664-ba4b-f06b8f98b899/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/" alt="06" loading="lazy"/>

        <div class="project-video" style="position:relative;">
          <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1059127497?h=dbbdd54652&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&amp;autoplay=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="cards-responsive" loading="lazy"></iframe>

        <p>The product roadmap is structured so that multiple major news items can appeat simultaneously, with up to five fresh generic news pieces per day. To manage this, the first row of news is customizable via the admin panel, allowing users to “pin” up to four news items. The layout adjusts dynamically across all resolutions.</p>

        <p>Additionally, the premium shop banner’s position was initially undefined, so we accounted for scenarios where it might replace a news item. This option remains toggleable, enabling quick adjustments to push the banner higher if the CTR ever drops.</p>
        
        <img class="project-image" src="https://ucarecdn.com/9100eb2e-2830-4ddf-864c-d6fae6683873/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/" alt="07" loading="lazy"/>

        <p>This section consolidates all purchasable content, including in-game items and store entry points. The first three cards link to specific item store pages, while the two banners lead to the main store pages.</p>
        <img class="project-image" src="https://ucarecdn.com/9636976f-a803-4c61-a846-f91b24fd5e5c/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/" alt="08" loading="lazy"/>

        <p>The layout is simpler since there’s no pinning functionality. However, if the setting to push the banner up is toggled, the section will display four items instead of three.</p>
