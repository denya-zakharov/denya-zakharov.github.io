      <p>2024/ World of Tanks Homepage Redesign </p>

      <div class="project-images" id="project-images">
        <p>The WoT Homepage Redesign was a major project I took on as part of the Web Stream in World of Tanks. I focused on the UX/UI design for the homepage—covering all widgets and selected Admin Panel areas needing UX upgrades. My goal was to deliver a seamless, transparent experience while keeping everything consistent and compatible with the existing WoT portal infrastructure. The team included a System Designer, Producer, PM, Frontend/Backend devs, and QA, with everyone playing a key role in shaping and executing the project.</p>

        </div>

        <p>The main goal was to boost both reach and retention of the official portal's audience by making it more useful and convenient for users. We revamped the visual and functional aspects to drive higher engagement with current in-game events and systems. For the active audience, the aim was to ramp up engagement with ongoing events and news, while for monthly active users (NewMAU), the focus was on maintaining or even improving conversion rates. In both cases, it was crucial to avoid any drop in visits and premium shop banner clicks.</p>

        <p>The WoT portal used to sort users into categories based on cookies and some additional rules, which allowed for content personalization. We reworked the system to simplify segmentation and better align it with product requirements—reducing the groups to just two: new players and returning players.</p>

        <p>As a result, each user group now experiences a tailored version of the page. New players see an onboarding promo block designed to encourage registration and game downloads, while returning players are presented with the latest major news update.</p>

        <p>World of Tanks has a long history, with countless updates and reworks over the years. As a result, keeping track of current guidelines and standards was nearly impossible. This challenge became the perfect opportunity to introduce a structured set of guidelines and commit to maintaining them. We established standards covering typography, iconography, colors, spacing, content area width, and responsive breakpoints. Now, design and development have a clear set of rules to follow for all future updates, ensuring consistency and coherence every step of the way.</p>
        <img class="project-image" src="https://ucarecdn.com/73ac0e20-1a94-4097-9361-e431a8a449ab/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/" alt="figma variables illustration" loading="lazy"/>
        
        <p>After a series of brainstorming sessions and a few months in the concept phase while gathering approvals and feedback we mapped out a clear list of changes for the MVP scope. These changes included:</p>

        <ul class="project-list">
          <li class="project-list-item">Menu Update: Fixed mobile behavior and added support for a new content area on desktop. A planned category rework didn't make it into the MVP.</li>
          <li class="project-list-item">New Players / Returning Players Section (Promo Block): Implemented a cookie-driven approach to tailor content for different user groups.</li>
          <li class="project-list-item">News Section Rework: Expanded the number of news items, established clear prioritization, and adapted the layout for varying counts of key news items.</li>
          <li class="project-list-item">Monetization Section Update: Created a dedicated method to promote in-game items for special promotions. While these were once presented as news items, the redesign turned them into direct links to the Premium Store. An entry point for the Premium and Merch Store was planned but ultimately moved to a dedicated category on the page; later tests showed no significant CTR difference.</li>
          <li class="project-list-item">Event Calendar: Introduced a structured timeline to display in-game activities.</li>
          <li class="project-list-item">Customization Presets for Special Events: Enabled thematic design updates for occasions like New Year and Anniversary celebrations.</li>
          <li class="project-list-item">Footer and Language Selector Update: Refined both the footer layout and the language selector.</li>
        </ul>
        <img class="project-image" src="https://ucarecdn.com/e95e51c7-22a0-4fa0-9bda-928c44b5c135/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/" alt="01" loading="lazy"/>

        <p>The most significant update was on mobile. Previously, there were two large buttons: the left one opened the category menu for navigating the portal, while the right one tried to launch a shared menu across all WOT products—the so-called Common Menu. In the new design, the main navigation has been moved to the left for easier access, and the Common Menu now stays visible at the top. Plus, a "Create Account" CTA has been added.</p>

        <p>One issue that still needs attention is that categories like "Game" and "Guides" have their own pages. The initial plan was to completely restructure the menu, but time constraints and legacy issues made that impossible. As a temporary solution, tapping the category name now opens the page, while tapping elsewhere triggers a dropdown—previously, you had to tap the icon on the right to access it. A proper fix is planned for MVP+.</p>

          <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1059855025?h=7101c48637&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&amp;autoplay=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Recording 2025-02-24 205707"></iframe>
        </div>
        <script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></div>


        <p>Latest News is the main spot where you catch all the freshest updates—whether that's breaking news, exciting collaborations, or other cool developments. Went with a card layout because it hits the sweet spot of flexibility and familiarity.</p>

        <img class="project-image" src="https://ucarecdn.com/89909d9d-ca71-40be-8e05-7cb0ef7fb112/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/" alt="05" loading="lazy"/>

        <p>We prioritized a consistent card component to cover all potential use cases. Currently, it supports two types—News and Special Items—with additional types planned. The card features tags, dates, buttons, an image, and text, along with two alignment options (horizontal and vertical) and three interaction states (default, hover, and visited). Using a uniform image size and safe content area across all cards streamlines asset preparation and saves significant time.</p>

        <img class="project-image" src="https://ucarecdn.com/6a282fc4-0516-4664-ba4b-f06b8f98b899/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/" alt="06" loading="lazy"/>

        <div class="project-video" style="position:relative;">
          <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1059127497?h=dbbdd54652&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&amp;autoplay=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="cards-responsive" loading="lazy"></iframe>
        </div>
        <script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

        <p>The product roadmap is designed so that several major news items can appear at once, with up to five fresh generic news pieces every day. To manage this, the first row of news is customizable via the admin panel—users can pin up to four news items. Plus, the layout adjusts dynamically across all resolutions.</p>

        <p>Additionally, the premium shop banner’s position wasn't fixed at first, so we planned for scenarios where it might replace a news item. This option remains toggleable, allowing us to quickly adjust its placement—pushing the banner higher if the CTR ever drops.</p>

        <img class="project-image" src="https://ucarecdn.com/9100eb2e-2830-4ddf-864c-d6fae6683873/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/" alt="07" loading="lazy"/>

        <p>This section brings together all purchasable content—from in-game items to direct store access. The first three cards link straight to dedicated item store pages, while the two banners direct users to the main store pages.</p>
        <img class="project-image" src="https://ucarecdn.com/9636976f-a803-4c61-a846-f91b24fd5e5c/-/format/auto/-/quality/smart/" alt="08" loading="lazy"/>

        <p>The layout is more straightforward without any pinning functionality. However, if the push-banner setting is toggled, the section will display four items instead of three.</p>
